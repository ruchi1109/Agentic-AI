## SUMMARY

Experienced Data Scientist/ML Engineer with 3+ years building production-grade machine learning solutions, specializing in LLMs, GenAI, and data automation. Proven track record of delivering business-critical ML models that reduce processing time by 95% while maintaining high quality standards. Strong focus on practical, iterative development with expertise in Python, R, cloud environments, and model deployment pipelines.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Associate Data Scientist
**GlaxoSmithKline, Bangalore, India** | *May 2023 - Present*

- Independently developed end-to-end open-source R package for automated pharmaceutical submission data validation, designed for CRAN repository publication. Built complete Shiny application performing quality checks using flexible pattern matching for clinical trial data formats and medical terminology standards. Created comprehensive testing framework and cross-platform deployment solution for regulatory compliance workflows.

- Developed an AI tool that used GenAI approaches like GAN and VAEs, focusing on synthetic data generation utilizing CT-GAN, ADS-GAN, and TVAE models, and conducted a comparative analysis against real data to evaluate model performance and accuracy.

- Developed a tool using the XGBoost ML model, powered by a large language model, which marked a pivotal shift from a fully manual approach to an automated one, reducing development time from two weeks to one hour.

- Developed an end-to-end system to identify user intents in short texts, using unsupervised learning leveraging techniques such as clustering sentence embeddings, hyperparameter tuning of UMAP + HDBSCAN, and automatic cluster labeling.

### Junior Data Scientist
**GlaxoSmithKline, Bangalore, India** | *Feb 2022 - April 2023*

- Led a project to collate data from diverse sources and implemented semantic search functionality using the Reinforcement Learning, Haystack framework and RoBERTa language model resulting in a 50 percent reduction in man-hours.

- Developed a Python-based solution utilizing the LayoutLM model to detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in documents by implementing advanced preprocessing and tokenization techniques, enhancing automated detection and reinforcing data security compliance.

- Developed a Power BI dashboard integrated with a web-based data entry system, providing a single source of verified information, reducing validation time, and enabling faster data-driven decisions.
